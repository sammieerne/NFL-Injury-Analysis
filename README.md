# NFL-Injury-Analysis
A group of undergraduate students led by a professor conducting research on NFL football injuries.
Our goal is to analyze NFL injuries that occured between 2019 and 2023 based on a variety of factors such 
as field type (turf or grass), weather, player position, contact or non-contact hit, and more.
We ultimately will use this data to create a model that will predict injury likelihood for NFL players.
We will also analyze the data and search for patterns that lead to injury based on the measured variables. 
We are currently writing a research paper to submit to the American Journal of Sports Medicine
detailing our findings.
