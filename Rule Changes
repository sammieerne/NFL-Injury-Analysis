The NFL has undergone some rule changes in recent years which could affect the injuries we are measuring. The following rule changes were implemented by
the NFL, and we are considering them as part of our injury analysis.

2016- the chop block was outlawed from all running plays, the last play type where it was allowed

2018- Rules about roughing the passer changed making it illegal to land on the QB with your full body weight

2022- If a player is put on IR they must miss at least 4 regular season games before being reactivated (up from 3)
      Teams will only have 8 chances to activate players from return (down from infinite)
      A player can only be on IR twice a season
